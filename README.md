The problem trying to solve:
Trying to build an online used car buying application which can provide an interface where users can identify and narrow vehicle choices based on the key features and attributes that are important to them and help them find something that exactly matches their search on the site.
Types of users: user, admin
Goals:
for  user : 1. Search cars by inputting some features and attributes 
	       2.  Compare different cars by some features or attributes 
for admin:
Create  new records of cars
Update carsâ€™ information
Delete records of cars
Overall strategy :
		Build a client application with JavaScript, React and Redux.  
		Build a server with Java and Restful api.
Work with data available from some public, free, Web API.
(Use MySql database to store data.)
		Deploy the client and server on Heroku.
 A brief description of the Web API:

3. The problem trying to solve:
   - Trying to build a online cocktail website which can provide an interface where users can identify and narrow cocktail choices based on the key features and attributes that are important to them and help them find something that exactly matches their search on the site.
Types of users: user, admin
4. Goals:
  - for user : 
    - Search cocktail by inputting some features and attributes 
    - Compare different cocktails by some features or attributes 
  - for admin:
    - Create new records of cocktail
    - Update cocktailsâ€™ information
    - Delete records of cocktail
5. Overall strategy :
   - Build a client application with JavaScript, React and Redux.  
   - Build a server with Java and Restful api.
   - Work with data available from some public, free, Web API.
   - (Use MySql database to store data.)
   - Deploy the client and server on Heroku.
6. A brief description of the Web API:
   - [Web API Link](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
   - This Web API can give 1000s cocktails, can search for recipes, images of specific cocktails, ingredients, filter by alcoholic, non alcoholic and so on.
